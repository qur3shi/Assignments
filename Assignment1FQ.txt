Current date and time : 

2019-11-04 22:39:47.018343

4. Write a Python program which accepts the radius of a circle from the user and compute the area
pi = 3.14159;

rad = float(input("Input the radius of the circle : "));

area = pi * rad**2;

print ("Area is : ");

print(area);
Input the radius of the circle : 8

Area is : 
201.06176



5. Write a Python program which accepts the user's first and last name and print them in reverse order with a space between them.
Code:
firstName = input("Enter First Name : ");
